TSCAN Example Datasets
====

This repository contains three example datasets for TSCAN: HSMM dataset without prior differential gene expression information; HSMM dataset with prior differential gene expression information; and LPS dataset. NOTE: all data have been log transformed. DO NOT enable log transformation in the GUI if you wish to reproduce the results in the paper.
